            High-level me is all about health, learning, and overall trying to be a better person. I believe that learning and working on oneself is tough, but really fullfilling and rewarding in the end.

        <p>
            Lower-level me enjoys diving into new things. I start a lot of my own projects by just jumping in and looking at documentation. I find it gratifyng
            to finish a project, and that drove me through a lot of my schoolwork. I love working with people as well, and I thrive in a space where collaboration is
            promoted and projects are pushed through to production often.

                        This project was my final project in my undergrad. I had the chance to work on the backend software 
                        of a dashboard that displayed the number of free parking spaces in a given parking lot at my university.
                        My group used ESP32 microcontrollers and laser sensors to count the number of cars going in and out of 
                        the parking lot driveway. These controllers then communicated to the backend on a remote server.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The backend work included defining logic for the controllers to connect to. This was done in python, and used
                        the MQTT Protocol to receive messages and insert the data into MySQL. Then, I created a java cron job that would interpret
                        the data to calculate the number of free parking spaces. This number was cached and accessed through a Java api for viewing in 
                        react application.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I really enjoyed programming in Java. It was interesting to learn about message protocol, and
                        to develop and api for my group. A favorite course of mine from undergrad was a systems programming elective. I 
                        learned about Unix programming, and had to dig into manuals and documentation for system calls that 
                        have been around longer than I have been alive. I believe this background helped me dive into the java programming that 
                        was needed to help create the backend for the project.

                        I like analyzing data and investigating what parts of my own data are being collected by the apps I use everyday. The following image
                        is a heatmap of my own instagram likes cleaned using python and displayed with seabord.

                        My hypothesis for the project was that my likes would be distributed fairly around my close group of friends from high school. The 
                        visual above shows that the hypothesis is definitely rejected. It was news to me, but the rock had more of my attention compared to 
                        other accounts by multiple orders of magnitude.

                        I also collected my tikTok data to do some analysis, but found that the only metric that had any integrity was search history. Other dimensions
                        either lacked working links, or did not have enougn data to be interesting. I encourage others to check out their own data! They can usually be 
                        accessed through app or on the apps website.

                        This project was the culmination of a data mining course from my undergrad. The project was individual, and I decided to ingest data from the famous Nigerian
                        Letter dataset. This was a collection of emails sent from scammers with the goal of getting money from the victim. The final code displayed some
                        visualizations on a website for a user to investigate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One of the parameters a user could change was the kinds of words to include or reject from the
                        data. Altering this parameter changed the visuals live, and when a user included all words for analysis the wordcloud looked like the one shown below. 
                        "Will" was such a large outlier it was almost removed from the set, but the word had a double meaning as a verb, as well as a noun for the document determing where 
                        money would go after someone passed away. It was defintely used often in this context to claim the victim was going to get money, but needed to pay
                        a small fee to claim it. The project was built in R using Shiny.

                        An interesting aspect of the project was learning to cache intermediary data so that the application could load quickly. I think this experience was 
                        valuable. The repo is here at <a href="https://github.com/jasonbconley/DataMiningProject">Github</a>.

                        This was the product of an elective I took in undergrad. C# was new to me, as well as the entire unity suite. I would say
                        the only part of the course I was comfortable in was the linear algebra aspect of the course. This was one bug I encountered that I thought was pretty funny.

                    <img src="img/funny.gif" alt="gif of game not working"/>
                    <p>
                        Nevertheless, I was able to create a final product, full of the most stunning volleyball gameplay never before seen.

                        <em>Sarcasm Alert</em>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        In the end it was a great learning experience, and if I ever get an itch to create something with unity, I can draw on this project for inspiration.
