            High-level me enjoys being with family and learning new things. I am always willing to try something new, and I am a strong believer in stepping outside of your comfort zone.</p>
        </p>
        <p>I am a Computer Science graduate, and am currently looking for opportunities in Software Engineering. I love to program, and I know that I would find the work of a Computing Professional to be fullfilling.</p>
        <p>
            Lower-level me is very detail-oriented, and loves to work in a group. I enjoy working with people, and I love to tinker with side projects. Recently I have been interested in configuring a raspberry-pi module to block ads on my home network. Technology excites me, and I am always looking for the next thing to dive into. (Currently its python)

                        This project was my final project in my undergrad. I had the chance to work on the backend software 
                        of a dashboard that displayed the number of free parking spaces in a given parking lot at my university.
                        My group used ESP32 microcontrollers and laser sensors to count the number of cars going in and out of 
                        the parking lot driveway. These controllers then communicated to the backend on a remote server.
                    </p>

                    </figure>
                    <p>
                        The backend work included defining logic for the controllers to connect to. This was done in python, and used
                        the MQTT Protocol to receive messages and insert the data into MySQL. Then, I created a Java API built with Spring that would present 
                        the data with regard to user permissions.

                        This project was the culmination of a data mining course. The project was individual, and I decided to use the famous Nigerian
                        Letter dataset. This was a collection of emails sent from scammers with the goal of getting money from the victim. The final code displayed some
                        visualizations on a website for a user to investigate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One of the parameters a user could change was the kinds of words to include or reject from the
                        data. Altering this parameter changed the visuals live, and when a user included all words for analysis the wordcloud looked like the one shown below. 
                        The project was built in R using Shiny.

                        An interesting aspect of the project was learning to cache intermediary data so that the application could load quickly. I think this experience was 
                        valuable. The repo is here at <a href="https://github.com/jasonbconley/DataMiningProject">Github</a>.

                        This was the product of an elective I took in undergrad. C# was new to me, as well as the entire unity suite. I would say
                        the only part of the course I was comfortable in was the linear algebra aspect of the course. This was one bug I encountered that I thought was pretty funny.

                    </figure>
                    <p>
                        Nevertheless, I was able to create a final product, full of the most stunning volleyball gameplay never before seen.

                    </figure>
                    <p>
                        In the end it was a great learning experience, and if I ever get an itch to create something with unity, I can draw on this project for inspiration.
